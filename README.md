# Project: Predicting employees leaving
This project is a capstone project for Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate on Coursera. In this project, I will apply data analytics skills and knowledge which I have learned from this course to solve a business problem.

**Overview**  
The goal of this project was to create a logistic regression model to predict employees likely to quit.

**Data Understanding**  
This project uses a dataset called HR_capstone_dataset.csv came from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mfaisalqureshi/hr-analytics-and-job-prediction?select=HR_comma_sep.csv). It represents 10 columns of self-reported information from employees of a fictitious multinational vehicle manufacturing corporation. The dataset contains 14,999 rows – each row is a different employee’s self-reported information. 

**Findings**  
After cleaning and analyzing data, there are some findings as followed:
- Employees at the company are overworked.
- The longer employees stay at a company, the less likely they are to leave.
- The low level of satisfaction and no chance of promotion are the main reasons why employees left.
